# hugo-bare-minimum
This was my attempt to create a bare minimum Hugo theme for my dev blog.

It didn't take long for me to become frustrated with Hugo's bizarre template language and lookup rules, so this theme is currently incomplete.

Issues:

* Index page is just a link to the list of posts
* List of posts page should use summaries or the first paragraph of content and not the entire post
* No link to RSS feed
* Dates don't render correctly
* Link to site root isn't implemented
* And probably many more problems I haven't noticed yet
